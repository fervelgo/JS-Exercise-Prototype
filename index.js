    TASK 1
      - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
      - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.

          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
          + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

  /* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. Window/global: the broadest context for this to live in. It's the broadest context -this- can have. It is literally global, in which case it may be more problematic than useful, but it still is explanatory towards how -this- works.
    2. Implicit: Takes the bounds of a preceding function. Whenever the function called has a preceding function, that will be what -this- point to in that case. 
    3. New binding: When we create a new function from a constructor function, -this- refers to the parameters in the constructor, that are passed when calling it with the new function we are creating. So, -this- ultimately refers to the parameters we pass to the constructor via the new function we create with said constructor.
    4. Explicit binding: Being explicit when we call for a function can be useful because it overrides the constructor function. In that case -this- points to the overriding function we are feeding either the .call or the .apply method.
